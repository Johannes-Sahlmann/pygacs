To install this package in your site-wide python installation use:

python setup.py install

If you do not have root access the following should work:

python setup.py install --user

The installation will then end up in the ~/.local folder

WARNING: the setup uses the distribute_setup package which requires a network
connection. If you do not have a network connection try commenting out the
lines:

from distribute_setup import use_setuptools
use_setuptools()

in the setup.py script. The installation should then still be possible with the
commands given above.
