pygacs
======

**Python toolkit to manipulate Gaia catalogue tables hosted at ESA's Gaia Archive Core Systems (GACS)**

pygacs provides python modules for the access and manipulation of
tables in GACS, e.g. basic query on a single table or crossmatch between two tables. It employs the TAP command line access tools described
in the 'Help' section of the GACS web pages (`<http://archives.esac.esa.int/gaia/>`_). 

Both public and authenticated access have been
implemented.

Please see pygacsExample_publicAccess.py for a demo on how public tables can easily be queried using ADQL.

To fully use pygacs, in particular to upload a table for
crossmatch operations, you will need to be a registered user of GACS
and call the example script pygacsExample.py with your access credentials.


Basic example usage
-------------

# import module

import pygacs.public.publicAccessTools as pgp 

# define ADQL query

queryString = '''SELECT * FROM gaiadr1.tgas_source WHERE parallax >
100; '''

# define local file to store query result in a VO table

outputFileName = path + 'ADQL_query_result.vot';

# execute query

pgp.retrieveQueryResult(queryString,outputFileName);

# read result into astropy table

T = Table.read(outputFileName,format='votable')



Documentation
-------------

All classes and methods/functions include basic documentation.
